# External Knowledge – Let’s create a “Microsoft Surface Documentation“ Agent in Agent Builder

## Create an agent at [microsoft365.com/chat](https://microsoft365.com/chat) with the following details:

- **Name**: Microsoft Surface Documentation
- **Purpose**: Answer Microsoft Surface product related questions based on the Microsoft Learn public website only.

## Additional Setup

- Add the public website [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/) as external knowledge.
- Enable **Web search**.

## Test Your Agent

Test your agent by, for example, asking:  
**“What versions of the Surface Laptop 7 exist?”**

## Tips

Feel free to play with the instructions to get even more out of it!

## Bonus Task

Use Copilot or a visual creator to design a logo for your agent!
