# Hackathon Project: "Build Your Own Agent!"

## Objective
Groups will collaboratively brainstorm, build, and present their own agent use-case within a short timeframe.

## Agenda

### 1. Team Formation (5 minutes)
- Participants are divided into teams of **3-5 people**.
- Each team forms a working group.

### 2. Brainstorming the Use-Case (30 minutes)
- Teams brainstorm and develop a **unique idea** for an agent.
- Guiding questions:
  - What problem does the agent solve?
  - Who are the intended users?
  - What data or systems are needed?
  - What key features should the agent have?

- Results should be captured on a whiteboard or in a shared document.

### 3. Building the Agent (30 minutes)
- Each team builds a functional prototype based on their idea.
- The agent must be built **exclusively using the Agent Builder in Microsoft Copilot for BizChat**.

- Focus on creating a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
  - Implement only the most critical features.

### 4. Presentation (5 minutes per team)
- Each team presents:
  - The idea
  - The developed agent (live demo or screenshots)
  - Key challenges and lessons learned

- One person from each team will lead the presentation.

### 5. Feedback and Closing (15 minutes)
- Short feedback session: What went well? What could be improved?
